Introducing my remarkable calculator, a meticulously designed tool equipped with integrated features for percentages and averages! This extraordinary creation has been tailor-made specifically for Excel users, addressing the challenges associated with memorizing complex formulas and eliminating the inconvenience of switching between multiple calculators.

The driving force behind this project emerged from the frustrations of formula retention and the constant need to juggle between various calculators to perform average calculations, percentage conversions, and basic arithmetic operations. With my all-in-one calculator, you can effortlessly execute these calculations within a single, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI), revolutionizing your calculation experience.

Let's embark on a journey to explore the different components that make my calculator exceptional. At its core, the "Main.py" file serves as the entry point, encompassing the startup page and orchestrating intelligent conditional statements. This ingenious design ensures intuitive navigation, seamlessly guiding users to their desired commands with ease and efficiency.

To enhance functionality and maximize user convenience, I have meticulously crafted three additional files: "calc.py," "avg.py," and "prec.py." These files adhere to a coherent concept, each offering a diverse range of commands tailored to specific calculations. Within them, powerful functions have been meticulously implemented to effortlessly locate and display the desired results for average calculations, percentage conversions, and standard arithmetic operations.

While my calculator boasts an impressive array of capabilities, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. The "calc" function primarily excels at solving simple two-number problems, making complex mathematical operations involving multiple numbers or intricate parentheses, such as ((23+1321)7)/3213, unsuitable for its scope. Nevertheless, in the majority of situations, this calculator provides ample functionality to effectively address your calculation needs.

Embrace the exceptional prowess of my calculator, meticulously designed to simplify your Excel work and alleviate the burden of formula memorization. With its seamlessly integrated features for percentages, averages, and a user-friendly interface, this powerful tool is poised to revolutionize your calculation workflow, ultimately enhancing productivity and propelling you to new heights of success.
