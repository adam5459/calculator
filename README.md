# Calculator + 
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/cP0MexdS5Kk
#### Description:
a calculator with percentages and averages built in and is great for 
when working in Excel and not wanting to remember all the formulas!


  I created this project because it can be hard to memorize formulas 
and tabbing between average, percentage and normal calculators can 
be tedious with this you can do all the calculations in one cli. 



Main.py contains the startup page for the calculator and the if 
statements to find out what command was picked.

calc,avg,prec.py all contain the same concept of commands, they all 
contain the functions of which used to find and print out the 
average, percentage, or normal calculations.

the main restraint with this app is the lack of advanced math possible with 
the calc function, this means that you can only do 2 number problems and can not
have math problems like ((23+1321)7)/3213 but in most situations it is enough to 
get the job done.
